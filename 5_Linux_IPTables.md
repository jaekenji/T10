Letâ€™s say that you are on your computer (IP Address: 10.50.45.33)
and you want to establish two-way communications with a host in a private network with an IP of 192.168.99.101 on port 22.

You have gained access, via ssh, to the router (IP Address 10.50.86.80)
 which is running a *Nix OS with IPTables installed and loaded and an internal IP address of 192.168.99.254.

How would you accomplish this using the Network Address Translation table of IPTables on the router?
